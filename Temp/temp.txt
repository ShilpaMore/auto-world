Basic Workflow

Once you've created the repository and done your first commit, or forked it onto your local drive this is the basic workflow:
git status - displays what files have changed or been added or deleted.

git add -A - adds all changes ("stages" the files). The A flag adds all changes.

git commit -m "your message" - commits all changes and adds a message describing this change.

git push - pushes your changes to the remote repository.

Here's a very useful cheat sheet with multiple basic git commands.

Synchronizing Changes

You may do this in a couple of ways. You can use git fetch in combination with git merge or just git pull. The recommended method is just to do git pull. Here's a description of what they do:

git fetch - gets all the changes from the repository but doesn't change your local files.

git merge - combines the changes that you just fetched to update your files.

git pull - downloads all the changes and updates your local files.

Other
rm -rf .git/ - to remove that directory from “version control”.
